        <h1>Scopes</h1>
        <p>
            This package is a toolkit for building custom scopes.  On the one hand,
            Guice's own docs advise against doing that;  this package aims to make
            it safe for mere mortals to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reasons you might want to do that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                AssistedInject is verbose and ugly.  More importantly, it requires
                a lot of boilerplate.  That's tolerable if you want to inject one
                or two "live" things.  But if you have a lot of them, it
                starts to affect readability and maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your application has any sort of natural request/response
                cycle, and you want the code in your application to be clean
                and readable, you probably want to parse your request-thing into
                the objects that will actually be used by the things that handle
                requests.
            </li>
            <li>
                Guice suffers from a belief that a lot of frameworks suffer from:
                that its authors are the only people in the world writing a
                framework, and everybody else is writing fairly trivial applications.
                Yet if you want to do good software, you probably should be
                dividing your own work into decoupled frameworks too.
                <p/>
                Which means, despite the protestations of Guice's docs, you're
                <i>going</i> to write code that handles the <code>Injector</code>,
                or <i>you</i> get to take advantage of Guice but the users of your
                framework can't - at least not in any non-trivial way.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Custom scopes provide a reasonable way to provide a pile of objects
            which should be injectable into objects down the call-chain, and a
            few utilities for doing multithreading in an environment with scopes.
        </p>
        <h2>Using Custom Scopes</h2>
        <p>
            This is a fairly small library, as it should be.  The heart of it is
            <code><a href="AbstractScope.html">AbstractScope</a></code>.  Typically
            you will create an instance of <code><a href="ReentrantScope.html">ReentrantScope</a></code>
            or <code><a href="SingleEntryScope.html">SingleEntryScope</a></code>.
            You <i>enter</i> the scope with some objects which are made available
            for injection.  The <code>enter()</code> method returns an 
            <code>AutoCloseable</code> which ensure the scope is exited properly.
        </p>
        <pre>
            // bind the types you will use inside your scope in your Guice
            // module!

            AbstractScope scope = new ReentrantScope();

            try (AutoCloseable ac = scope.enter("hello")) {
                // here the injector can inject "hello" for String.class
            }
        </pre>
        <p>
            Probably you noticed that inside the <code>try</code> block above,
            you will still have to write code that directly handles the injector.
            On the one hand, that's frowned upon.  On the other hand, <i>something</i>
            is touching the injector if you're using AssistedInject, so the idea
            that there is something evil about doing that was always a fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, we do provide a way to encapsulate doing that and
            do it in a consistent way.  For that case, you simply subclass
            <code>Runnable</code> or <code>Callable</code> and pass the <code>Class</code>
            object for it to a <code>ScopeRunner</code> for your scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            If, as is commonly the case, your application has only one "request"
            or request-like scope, the simplest thing is to bind <code>AbstractScope</code>
            to the scope instance you want to use (this also makes it easier to
            write tests for scope contents by replacing the scope in tests).
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is a simple example of how this works in practice
        </p>
        <pre>
    &#064;Test
    public void testScopeRunner() throws Exception {
        ScopesModule module = new ScopesModule();
        Injector inj = Guice.createInjector(module);
        
        // We will inject this StringBuilder into an instance of C below
        StringBuilder constant = new StringBuilder("hello");

        // ScopeRunner wraps the Injector and lets us instantiate C and get it
        // injected with objects only available in the scope
        ScopeRunner r = inj.getInstance(ScopeRunner.class);
        AbstractScope scope = r.scope();

        try (AutoCloseable cl = scope.enter(constant)) {
            assertTrue(scope.inScope());
            StringBuilder sb = r.call(C.class);
            assertNotNull(sb);
            assertSame(constant, sb);
            assertEquals("hello", sb.toString());
        }
    }
    
    static class C implements Callable&lt;StringBuilder&gt; {
        private final StringBuilder sb;
        &#064;Inject
        C(StringBuilder sb) {
            this.sb = sb;
        }

        &#064;Override
        public StringBuilder call() throws Exception {
            return sb;
        }
    }

    private static final class ScopesModule extends AbstractModule {
        &#064;Override
        protected void configure() {
            ReentrantScope scope = new ReentrantScope();
            bind(AbstractScope.class).toInstance(scope);
            scope.bind(binder(), String.class, StringBuilder.class, Integer.class);
        }
    }
        </pre>

        <h2>Thread Pools</h2>
        <p>
            Guice's scopes are typically just magical wrappers for ThreadLocals, and
            in fact that's what the Scope subclasses here are, for the most part.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing which is useful and not generally simple, once you're dealing
            with scopes, is the notion that you might need to re-dispatch work
            on another thread.  For example, one use of this project is in
            a framework which uses Netty to do single-threaded, highly scalable
            web servers.  If you need to actually do blocking work, you have to
            have a way to shuffle that work off into a thread-pool.  If you're
            using injection, of course it would be nice to be able to bring the
            scope contents with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            So the one other thing this library does is make it easy to do that -
            just use <code>AbstractScope.wrapThreadPool(ExecutorService)</code>
            to wrap a JDK thread-pool with one which lets you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Submit a runnable within a scope, and have the current contents of
                the scope preserved
            </li>
            <li>
                Have the same contents the scope had when your Runnable/Callable
                was created set back up
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On the one hand, this means that any objects that were in-scope when
            something was submitted to the thread pool will exist until the runnable
            or callable you submitted has exited.  On the other hand, most 
            other ways to do this sort of callback programming do the same thing
            based on the visibility of variables.
